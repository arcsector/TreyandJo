                                        <p>Jo and I had been dating for over 5 years before we got engaged, and when everyone hears that fact, more often than not, they exclaim that we must be crazy to date for so long! I would say that is quite a good amount of time to get to know someone - through that period of time I have realized that it's not the amount of time that you spend with someone that counts (though for some it does), but the quality of the time that you spend with them. Our time is spent enriching each other and making fun of our quirks and eccentricities; the way that I would describe the time that Jo and I spend together is mostly jokes, with a healthy serving of deep converstaion about topics we care about deeply. Jo can tickle my funny bone like no one else can, and that is one of my favorite qualities about her, next to her beautiful smile, and her constant energy to make everything around her wholesome and beautiful.</p>

                                        <p>Through many changes over the past 5 or so years, there's been one consistent stream of joy and happiness which came from being with Trey and growing as a couple. If it weren't for his encouragement and love, I wouldn't have found myself pursuing a career that fulfills my curiousity and makes me feel empowered. Trey and I have been on many many dates over the years and yet one of my favorite memories has been one of our first dates to the UCR botanical gardens. We had our very own Hallmark moment when the sprinklers turned on as we were about to kiss, making us run for our lives to avoid being drenched. In our hurry, I managed to slip and scrape my knee. Though I'm not entirely sure what ran through Trey's head, he swooped in and took the opportunity to show how prepared he was by getting his cute little first-aid kit from car to bandage me up.</p>
